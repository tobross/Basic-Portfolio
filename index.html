                Greetings! My name is Nathanial but most people call me Tobey. I'm happy to say that I am now a developer! Through UT's Coding Bootcamp, I have taken the dive into web and software development!
        </p>
        <p>
                I'm very excited to have finally found a type of learning and skillset that I understand fluidly and am excited to learn! This page that you're seeing currently is my very first homework assignment! 
        </p>
        <p>
                On this page you will find links to other pages including a page linking to future projects (links inactive at this time), and a contact page! This is all just for show right now, as there is no .php to back up the comment page. So, enjoy my site and feel free to put further improvement suggestions, which I will never receive!
